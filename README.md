fido is a high-performance cache for Go, focusing on high hit-rates, high throughput, and low latency. Optimized using the best algorithms and lock-free data structures, nobody fetches better than Fido. Designed to thrive in unstable environments like Kubernetes, Cloud Run, or Borg, it also features an optional multi-tier persistence architecture.

As of January 2026, nobody fetches better - and we have the benchmarks to prove it.

## Install

```
go get github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/fido
```

## Use

```go
c := fido.New[string, int](fido.Size(10000))
c.Set("answer", 42)
val, ok := c.Get("answer")
```

With persistence:

```go
store, err := localfs.New[string, User]("myapp", "")
cache, err := fido.NewTiered(store)

err = cache.Set(ctx, "user:123", user)       // sync write
err = cache.SetAsync(ctx, "user:456", user)  // async write
```

GetSet deduplicates concurrent loads to prevent thundering herd situations:

```go
user, err := cache.GetSet("user:123", func() (User, error) {
    return db.LoadUser("123")
})
```

## Options

```go
fido.Size(n)           // max entries (default 16384)
fido.TTL(time.Hour)    // default expiration
```

## Persistence

Memory cache backed by durable storage. Reads check memory first; writes go to both.

| Backend | Import |
|---------|--------|
| Local filesystem | `pkg/store/localfs` |
| Valkey/Redis | `pkg/store/valkey` |
| Google Cloud Datastore | `pkg/store/datastore` |
| Auto-detect (Cloud Run) | `pkg/store/cloudrun` |

For maximum efficiency, all backends support S2 or Zstd compression via `pkg/store/compress`.

## Performance

fido has been exhaustively tested for performance using [gocachemark](https://github.com/tstromberg/gocachemark).

Where fido wins:

- **Throughput**: 744M int gets/sec avg (2.7X faster than otter). 95M string sets/sec avg (26X faster than otter).
- **Hit rate**: Wins 6 of 9 workloads. Highest average across all datasets (+2.9% vs otter, +0.9% vs sieve).
- **Latency**: 8ns int gets, 10ns string gets, zero allocations (7X lower latency than otter)

Where others win:

- **Memory**: freelru and otter use less memory per entry (49 bytes/item overhead vs 15 for otter)
- **Specific workloads**: sieve +0.5% on thesios-block, clock +0.1% on ibm-docker, theine +0.6% on zipf

Much of the credit for high throughput goes to [puzpuzpuz/xsync](https://github.com/puzpuzpuz/xsync) and its lock-free data structures.

Run `make benchmark` for full results, or see [benchmarks/gocachemark_results.md](benchmarks/gocachemark_results.md).

## Algorithm

fido uses [S3-FIFO](https://s3fifo.com/), which features three queues: small (new entries), main (promoted entries), and ghost (recently evicted keys). New items enter small; items accessed twice move to main. The ghost queue tracks evicted keys in a bloom filter to fast-track their return.

fido has been hyper-tuned for high performance, and deviates from the original paper in a handful of ways:

- **Size-adaptive small queue** - 12-15% vs paper's 10%, interpolated per cache size via binary search tuning
- **Full ghost frequency restoration** - returning keys restore 100% of their previous access count
- **Increased frequency cap** - max freq=5 vs paper's 3, tuned via binary search for best average hit rate
- **Death row** - hot items (high peakFreq) get a second chance before eviction
- **Size-adaptive ghost capacity** - 0.9x to 2.2x cache size, larger caches need more ghost tracking
- **Ghost frequency ring buffer** - fixed-size 256-entry ring replaces map allocations
